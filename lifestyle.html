                  Honest Crust’s wood-burning pizza ovens are a fixture in the iconic Altrincham Market House and at its Manchester NQ offshoot, the Mackie Mayor. Their sourdough dough is fermented for a minimum of 36 hours. The only ingredients are flour, water and salt.<br>
                   Each pizza is stretched by hand and blasted at 450c for less than 90 seconds in the oven. Ingredients for the toppings are scrupulously sourced, too. Our favourite pizza created by Crust’s Richard Carver is Atomica! with its simple topping of spicy ‘nduja sausage,<br>
                    tomato and mozzarella.
