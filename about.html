   <h1>HISTORY OF MANCHESTER</h1>
    <img src="images/train.jpg" class="pic-class">
    
    <p>
    Manchester has somewhat of a unique historical background,what most people find suprising is the fact hta machester
     is actualy the birthplace of the first modern<br> computer.On june 1948,shortly after 11 am,the small scale<br> experiment Macjine(SEEM) was
    nicknamed "THE BABY"-executed its first program,thanks to Tm Kilburn and Freddie Williams.<br><br>
    The baby changed the world and was the forerunner of all modern computers,ipods,mobile phones and other gadgets we take for granted today

    One fact you may not have known is that Manchester is actually considered as the birthplace of the industrial revolution
    ,the city  is credited with the invention and evelopment of the firdt ever passenger railway and first bus service in Britain.
    the rail rod opened in 1825 and steam locomotives were used to run trains,built by George Stephenson,but it was originally meant to to be used for minerla transportion.

    <h1> HERE ARE SOME FUN FACTS YOU PROBABLY MAY NOT HAVE KNOWN ABOUT MANCHESTER:</h1><br><br>
    <p>
     
  1 – The birthplace of the meat-free diet
  Vegetarianism having its roots in a place called the Beefsteak Chapel doesn’t sound very plausible, but thanks to the aptly named
   Reverend William Cowherd, 
  it seems that it did. The tiny chapel was
   the place that the cleric preached to his flock about the virtues of vegetarianism, over two hundred years ago.
  
  At a time when many impoverished people were consuming the cheapest meat, the followers of the chapel instead adopted a meat free diet,
   and went on to form a Vegetarian Society in the city.<br><br>
  
   
  
  
   
  
  5 – Where the atom was split
  In yet another first, Manchester was the sight of the very first splitting of the atom. Nobel Prize winner Ernest Rutherford was the one who accomplished 
  the atom split in 1917 at the University of Manchester.
  
  The University named its physics lab The Rutherford Building in honour of the
   British physicist, and the historical scientific breakthrough resulted in the development 
   of nuclear power and cancer-fighting radiotherapy.
